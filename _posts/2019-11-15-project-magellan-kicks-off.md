## Idea outline
Create an app that lets travellers plan and optimize their trips. Keep all info around travels in one place: packing lists, activity and accomodation calendar, budget tracking in foreign currencies. The app is designed for vacation travel and business travel alike. 

## Planning steps
### Ideation phase
Draw up business model canvas, user stories, create backlog of technical tasks. Prioritize

### Validation phase
Create a prototype for the app, get instant user feedback and validation

### Technology
The goal is to create a modern web application that allows for both, rapid prototyping for immediate validation **and** future scalability and reliability

**Important**: The following posts in this series will go through the development stages of a Django app. There will be topics of various difficulty highlighted during the course of this process, but this will not be a 100$ step-by-step tutorial for creating a Django app. Some parts might be too high-level for beginners, others too in-depth for advanced users. I will try my best to highlight in the outline of each post what the focus is, and tag posts appropriately, so you may decide on which to read and which to skip. Should you be a beginner in developing, I recommend the following resources:


* [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org): Maybe *the* best resource for thorough and comprehensive intros on various topics around coding, mostly focussed on web development
* [simple is better than complex](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/): My favorite blog focussed on Django. The content is supreme, especially for beginners, since the author Vitor Freitas does fantastic work thoroughly explaining concepts while keeping it easy to understand.
